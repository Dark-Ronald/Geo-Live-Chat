# Geo Live Chat
A live chat Flutter widget.  Uses geolocation and compass to position messages around the perimeter of the screen in the direction that they were posted from, relative to the user.  Only messages within a local radius of a few city blocks are displayed.  Messages in close proximity appear in the center of the screen, in a random arrangement.  Messages are kept on screen for a duration based on the amount of characters in the message.  Messages that don't fit on screen due to screen being full are not displayed, to allow for time to read messages that are already on the screen.
